  title "The Ubuntu operating system must disable account identifiers
(individuals, groups, roles, and devices) after 35 days of inactivity."
  desc  "Inactive identifiers pose a risk to systems and applications because
attackers may exploit an inactive identifier and potentially obtain undetected
access to the system. Owners of inactive accounts will not notice if
unauthorized access to their user account has been obtained.

    Ubuntu operating systems need to track periods of inactivity and disable
application identifiers after 35 days of inactivity.

    Verify the account identifiers (individuals, groups, roles, and devices)
are disabled after 35 days of inactivity with the following command:

    Check the account inactivity value by performing the following command:

    # sudo grep INACTIVE /etc/default/useradd

    INACTIVE=35

    If \"INACTIVE\" is not set to a value 0<[VALUE]<=35, or is commented out,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to disable account identifiers after
35 days of inactivity after the password expiration.

    Run the following command to change the configuration for adduser:

    # sudo useradd -D -f 35

    Note: DoD recommendation is 35 days, but a lower value is acceptable. The
value \"0\" will disable the account immediately after the password expires.
