  desc  "The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible
combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. Password
length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength and how long
it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password helps to
exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to compromise the
password.

    Verify if the pwquality configuration file enforces a minimum 15-character
password length, by running the following command:

    # grep -i minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf
     minlen=15

    If \"minlen\" parameter value is not 15 or higher, or is commented out,
this is a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to enforce a minimum 15-character
password length.

    Add, or modify the \"minlen\" parameter value to the
\"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" file:

    minlen=15
