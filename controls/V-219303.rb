  desc  "A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops
work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.
Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session
prior to vacating the vicinity, the Ubuntu operating system need to be able to
identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
session lock.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined and/or controlled.

    Verify the Ubuntu operating system initiates a session logout after a
15-minute period of inactivity.

    Check that the proper auto logout script exists with the following command:

    # cat /etc/profile.d/autologout.sh
    TMOUT=900
    readonly TMOUT
    export TMOUT

    If the file \"/etc/profile.d/autologout.sh\" does not exist with the
contents shown above, the value of \"TMOUT\" is greater than 900, or the
timeout values are commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to initiate a session logout after a
15-minute period of inactivity.

    Create a file to contain the system-wide session auto logout script (if it
does not already exist) with the following command:

    # sudo touch /etc/profile.d/autologout.sh

    Add the following lines to the \"/etc/profile.d/autologout.sh\" script:

    TMOUT=900
    readonly TMOUT
    export TMOUT
