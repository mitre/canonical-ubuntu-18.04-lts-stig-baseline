  title "The Ubuntu operating system must have directories that contain system
commands set to a mode of 0755 or less permissive."
  desc  "If the Ubuntu operating system were to allow any user to make changes
to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without
undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust
change management process.

    This requirement applies to Ubuntu operating systems with software
libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted
languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute
with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be
allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of
initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Verify the system commands directories have mode 0755 or less permissive:

    /bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin

    Check that the system command directories have mode 0755 or less permissive
with the following command:

    # find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin
-perm /022 -type d -exec stat -c \"%n %a\" '{}' \\;

    If any directories are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this
is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the system commands directories to be protected from unauthorized
access. Run the following command:

    # sudo find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin
-perm /022 -type d -exec chmod -R 755 '{}' \\;
