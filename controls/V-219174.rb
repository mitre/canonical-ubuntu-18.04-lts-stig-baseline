  title "The Ubuntu operating system must enforce password complexity by
requiring that at least one numeric character be used."
  desc  "Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a
measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing
and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it
takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the
number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is
compromised.

  desc  'rationale', ''
  desc  'check', "
    Verify the Ubuntu operating system enforces password complexity by
requiring that at least one numeric character be used.

    Determine if the field \"dcredit\" is set in the
\"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" file with the following command:

    # grep -i \"dcredit\" /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    dcredit=-1

    If the \"dcredit\" parameter is greater than \"-1\", or is commented out,
this is a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Configure the Ubuntu operating system to enforce password complexity by
requiring that at least one numeric character be used.

    Add or update the \"/etc/security/pwquality.conf\" file to contain the
\"dcredit\" parameter:

    dcredit=-1
